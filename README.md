### RESEARCH

<br>

This Research Work involves:
- Study of "Misalignment Effects" between Lower Limb Structure and an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) in AFO users.
- 2D Link-segment Mathematical model used to simulate relative motion taking place between lower limb and the AFO for a functional range of ankle motion (-20 deg to +20 deg).
- Analysis of relative motions in Anterior-Posterior(A-P) and Proximal-Distal(P-D) directions between the lower limb and the AFO for a set of 4 test cases.
- The set of four test cases involve misalignments in:
    - Anterior to Posterior Direction
    - Proximal-Distal,
    - Anterior-Proximal to Posterior-Distal
    - Posterior-Proximal to Anterior-Distal
- Estimation of Calf Band Travel - Pistoning relative motion between the Lower Limb and the AFO.
- Prediction of Pressure Points on the leg by the inner surfaces of the AFO.

### REPO FILES

<br>

MATLAB / AFO_Graphical_Input.m
   * MATLAB file for AFO analysis with Graphical Input prompts.
   * The file is directly runnable and is fully UI-based wherein the user will be prompted to graphically pick misalignments within a circular range of 20mm radius.

<br>

MATLAB / AFO_Live_Script.mlx
   * MATLAB dynamic live script file for AFO analysis.
   * The file is directly runnable and is helpful for line-by-line retrospection of the code and the backend analysis.

<br>

MATLAB / AFO_Manual_Input.m
   * MATLAB file for AFO analysis with Manual Input (Typed) prompts.
   * The file is directly runnable and is UI-based wherein the user will be required to manually "type" in the misalignments in the input prompt.


<br>

MATLAB / AFO_Simulation.m, Simulation.m
   * MATLAB files for simulating/calculating relative motions for all 4 misalignment cases considered.

<br>

MS Excel / AFO_Analysis.xlsx
   * MS Excel file with the dashboard for simulating Gait Analysis.
   * Provides UI-based dashboard for analysis as well as visually comprehending the misalignment effects.
