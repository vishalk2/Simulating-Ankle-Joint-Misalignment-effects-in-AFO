### ABOUT
The Research Project involves -
- Study of "Misalignment effects" between Lower limb structure and an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO).
- 2D Link-segment Mathematical model used to simulate relative motion taking place between lower limb and the AFO for a functional range of ankle motion.
- Estimation of Calf Band Travel.
- Calculations of Anterior-Posterior(A-P) & Proximal-Distal(P-D) relative motions between lower limb and the AFO for a set of 4 test cases.
- Prediction of Pressure Points on leg.
- Prediction of Pressure Points on foot.
- Estimation of Foot Strap movement.
- Gait Analysis.
